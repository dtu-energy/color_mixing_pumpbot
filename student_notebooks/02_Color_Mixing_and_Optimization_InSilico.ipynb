    "## Exercise 1.3: Optimization by mimicking the real pumpbot\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are gettting some good plots and have gotten a good feel for how different optimization methods and parameters work, you are ready to simulate the real pump bots. What do we mean by simulating the real pump bot? We mean adding two things to our simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add noise to the `SilicoPumpController`\n",
    "2. Inject the ways to pause the optimization sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for adding the noise is quite simple. Both the pumps and color sensor in your robot is not perfectly accurate, meaning that the color measurement you get is not exactly the same if you mix the same sample and measure its color multiple times. This noise affects your optimization performance, and we should include the noise in our simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason is more practical. As you have probably seen in the log files for some of your optimizations so far, the optimization steps can go up to several dozens or even more than a hundred. In this case, you will need to refill your color and water holder, or empty the drain container. For this reason, you will want the optimizer to pause once in a while, so you have time to check the status of the robot during the optimizaiton sequence. \n",
