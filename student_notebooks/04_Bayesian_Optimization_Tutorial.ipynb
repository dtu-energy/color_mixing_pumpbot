Samples and their outcome are collected sequentially and define our data $D$, e.g. $D = \\{x_i, f(x_i), \\cdots, x_n, f(x_n)\\}$ and is used to define the prior. The likelihood function is defined as the probability of observing the data given the function $P(D|f)$. This likelihood function will change as more observations are collected.\n",

    "\n",
    "The surrogate function is a technique used to best approximate the mapping of design parameters to an output score. It summarizes the conditional probability of an objective function ($f$), given the available data ($D$) or $P(f|D)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Gaussian Process (GP) construct a joint probability distribution over the variables, assuming a multivariate Gaussian distribution. As such, it is capable of efficient and effective summarization of a large number of functions and smooth transition as more observations are made available to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This smooth structure and smooth transition to new functions based on data are desirable properties as we sample the domain, and the multivariate Gaussian basis to the model means that an estimate from the model will be a mean of a distribution with a standard deviation; that will be helpful later in the acquisition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can fit a GP regression model using the [GaussianProcessRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor.html) scikit-learn implementation from a sample of inputs ($X$) and evaluations from the objective function ($y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the model must be defined. An important aspect in defining the GP model is the kernel. This controls the shape of the function at specific points based on distance measures between actual data observations. Many different kernel functions can be used, and some may offer better performance for specific datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a [Radial Basis Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function), or RBF, is used that can work well.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# define the model\n",
    "model = GaussianProcessRegressor()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once defined, the model can be fit on the training dataset directly by calling the `fit()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# fit the model\n",
    "model.fit(X, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will estimate the cost for one or more samples provided to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is used by calling the `predict()` function. The result for a given sample will be a mean of the distribution at that point. We can also get the standard deviation of the distribution at that point in the function by specifying the argument `return_std=True`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "yhat = model.predict(X, return_std=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function can result in warnings if the distribution is thin at a given point we are interested in sampling. Therefore, we silence all of the warnings when making a prediction. The `surrogate()` function below takes the fit model and one or more samples and returns the mean and standard deviation estimated costs without printing any warnings.\n",

    "\n",
    "We achieve this by first fitting the GP model on a random sample of 100 data points and their real objective function values. We can then plot a scatter plot of these points. Next, we can perform a grid-based sample across the input domain and estimate the cost at each point using the surrogate function and plot the result as a line.\n",
