    "Now we initialize the calibratebot. We need to figure out which port that the controller is connected to your computer. The `get_serial_port` should automatically do this for you, but things have a way of failing when you need them not to. That is why you can call the `list_serial_ports` function to see all the ports on your computer, and you can simply use the correct port as a string input instead of using the `get_serial_port` function. The `cell_volume` and `drain_time` properties are already defined to 15 mL and 15 seconds, respectively, but you have the option of changing them here. Notice that a folder called *logs* is created with a file with the current timestamp in it - this is where the colors that you mix on this controller in this session will be stored.\n",

    "Before doing anything else, we should purge all the pumps. This means filling all of the tubes with their respective liquids. We do this by using the `purge_pump` function, which takes the pump name ('R', 'G', 'B', 'Y', 'W', 'D') and time as variables. Do this one-by-one until all tubes are filled with liquid. The drain tubes of course do not need to be purged. If you are filling up the test cell, you can then drain the test cell using the `drain` function which by itself drains the whole cell for the defined drain time in the previous cell, but you can also define a custom drain time here. If needed you can also flush the cell with water using the `flush` function and then drain again."
