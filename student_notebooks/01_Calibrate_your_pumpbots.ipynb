    "Now we initialize the calibratebot. We need to figure out which port that the controller is connected to your computer. The `get_serial_port` should automatically do this for you, but things have a way of failing when you need them not to. That is why you can call the `list_serial_ports` function to see all the ports on your computer, and you can simply use the correct port as a string input instead of using the `get_serial_port` function. The `cell_volume` and `drain_time` properties are already defined to 15 mL and 15 seconds, respectively, but you have the option of changing them here. Notice that a folder called *logs* is created with a file with the current timestamp in it - this is where the colors that you mix on this controller in this session will be stored.\n",
